# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 21, 2020 
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started Etch a sketch project from T.O.P. today i spent 1 hr and 10 mins coding

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with js, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. i need to make sure the divs inside the parent div are functional/appearing after i styled them.

### Day 2: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the css grid issue. Finally the grid and grid items are visible after i styled them( its not necessary but i did this to make sure the grid is created) spent 1hr and 20 mins today , one step closer to finishing the project altho the hard parts are left. ;O

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: welp tbh i didnt achieve much but tried using an event listener for step 3 which is related to hovering and making the mouse pointer actually sketch however it didn't work as expected.

**Thoughts**: an article given to me (after addressing my issue) from the t.o.p discord server really helped me altho i still couldn't make the sketch function work but iam one again one step closer to finish the proj.

### Day 4: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally!!, the most important step for this project has been done. at last i was able to sketch on the grid aka the hover is working.

**Thoughts**: it seems that there was nothing wrong with the arrow function related to hovering however i wasn't using the correct way to select the div / grid items. i was once again saved by the discord server as i was told to try to use "document.querySelectorAll()" instead of using getelementbyid. its kinda silly how i forgot this method as its one of the dom basics but yeah that was good progress.

### Day 5: May 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: tbh, i barely did a thing today i just resized the grid and tried to do the last step ( i.e clearing the grid with a button)
**Thoughts**: well i had no idea how to pull the last step off so i once again seeked help and i got an interesting advice altho i kinda need to think in order how to implement it but i will give it a shot later on.
