<!--##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Started Etch a sketch project from T.O.P. today i spent 1 hr and 10 mins coding

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with js, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. i need to make sure the divs inside the parent div are functional/appearing after i styled them.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the css grid issue. Finally the grid and grid items are visible after i styled them( its not necessary but i did this to make sure the grid is created) spent 1hr and 20 mins today , one step closer to finishing the project altho the hard parts are left. ;O

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: welp tbh i didnt achieve much but tried using an event listener for step 3 which is related to hovering and making the mouse pointer actually sketch however it didn't work as expected.

**Thoughts**: an article given to me (after addressing my issue) from the t.o.p discord server really helped me altho i still couldn't make the sketch function work but iam one again one step closer to finish the proj.
